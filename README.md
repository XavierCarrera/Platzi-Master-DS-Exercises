<h2> Brief description: </h2>

**1. Basic Data Science Exercise with Python**

Data is arranged on a site sample, which needed to be manipulated to access data through indexing, calculating sums and means and apply regex.

**2. Basic Data Science Exercise with Python(2)**

A recommendation algorithm was developed in order to ease the purchase of ships by a group of investors. A data set of 158 entries was analyzed to assess the needed number of crew members to operate any given ship. The final outcome was a model that was trained to recommend the latter. Consequently, investors can properly calculate the total costs of purchasing any ship.
